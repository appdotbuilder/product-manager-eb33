  // The goal of this handler is deleting a product from the database by ID.
  // This would typically:
  // 1. Check if product exists by ID
  // 2. Delete product from products table
  // 3. Return true if successfully deleted, false if product not found
  
  // Mock logic: assume deletion is successful for any ID > 0
